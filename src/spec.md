# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set the site’s custom slug to `AryaTatainsurance` so the platform shareable URL works without validation errors.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the configured site slug/domain value to exactly `AryaTatainsurance` (replacing the previously invalid `Arya@Tata-Insurance`).
- Ensure the generated shareable site URL uses the new slug and passes platform validation (allowed characters/length), without changing any landing-page content or hash anchor behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** The site opens correctly via the platform’s shareable URL using the slug `AryaTatainsurance`, with no invalid-character error messages.
